      "Abstract:  We report the one-pot tandem synthesis of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butan-2-one directly from 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and acetone using a multifunctional supported AuPd nanoalloy catalyst. This one-pot synthesis involves dehydrogenation, aldol condensation and hydrogenation of C=C. In this supported AuPd catalyst, the bimetallic sites catalyse the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps and, in combination with the support, catalyse the C–C coupling (aldol) process. This supported bimetallic catalyst is also effective in utilizing hydrogen from the dehydrogenation reaction for the hydrogenation of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-3-en-2-one to 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butane-2-one via a hydrogen auto transfer route. These multifunctional catalysts were characterised using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In this dataset, we provide the meta data for the data we report in the article.\n",

      "Abstract:  Fluidised Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units (shown below) are one of the major conversion units in modern petrochemical refineries. ZSM-5 additives. These are used in FCC units to convert gasoline (mainly gasoline olefins) into lighter C3 and C4 olefins (propene and butenes).  Propene is a key feedstock for downstream petrochemical industry and plays a major role in a variety of polypropene products in the market.  There is a global supply shortage of propene and improving propene yields from FCC units is seen as one strategy for meeting that supply gap. This proposal, and a parallel QENS proposal, aims to understand how steam dealumination of ZSM-5 (which generates the working catalyst) modifies the behaviour of a model long-chain alkene reactant (1-octene) and the product, propene.\n",
